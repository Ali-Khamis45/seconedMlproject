🚀 End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Credit Risk Analysis & Loan Default Prediction
I am excited to share my latest project where I built a Machine Learning system to help banks minimize financial risk by predicting loan defaults with 93% Accuracy.
🔍 Project Overview: The goal was to analyze borrower data and build a predictive model to classify applicants as "Safe" or "Risky," supporting data-driven decision-making in the banking sector.
🛠️ Technical Journey & Key Highlights:
Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed 45,000+ records. Key insight: Loan-to-Income Ratio is the strongest indicator of default risk.
Preprocessing: Handled outliers, performed feature engineering, and applied One-Hot Encoding & Scaling.
Modeling: Trained and compared 5 algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Gradient Boosting).
Champion Model: Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance (93% Accuracy).
