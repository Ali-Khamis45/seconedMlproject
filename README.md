🚀 Credit Risk Analysis & Loan Default Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to help financial institutions minimize credit risk by predicting loan default probabilities using borrower data.

The system classifies applicants as Safe or Risky, enabling data-driven and smarter lending decisions.

📌 Project Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical challenge in the banking sector.
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to analyze borrower behavior and predict default risk with high accuracy.

Dataset Size: 45,000+ loan records

Problem Type: Binary Classification

Final Accuracy: 93%

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
🎯 Business Objective

Reduce financial risk caused by loan defaults

Improve loan approval decision-making

Support banks with an automated and scalable risk assessment system
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights discovered during analysis:

Loan-to-Income Ratio is the strongest indicator of default risk

Higher interest rates are strongly correlated with risky borrowers

Employment experience and income stability significantly impact loan repayment behavior

EDA helped guide feature selection and model choice.
